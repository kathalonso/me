                     Raised in a Spanish-English bilingual household, my tongue was the sharpest tool I had and I wanted to refine it even more by understanding language as a science. From there, I studied linguistics and areas complementing it. Briefly, I was a special education teacher assistant and found significant value in shadowing speech-language pathologists. Drawing upon their techniques enhanced my experience as an English teacher allowing me to cultivate students' fluency and accent reduction.

                     But everything changed when the fire nation attacked ... Just kidding! I went on to earn my master's in la bellisima Barcelona. (Yes, I partook in drinking and dancing to really immerse myself in the culture 😉) As a graduate student, I took on translation work here and there but what I really took to were positions regarding natural language processing and artificial intelligence. After Spain, web development caught my eye and gives me the opportunity to create something for the public showcasing my knowledge in various disciplines.

                     At the moment, I'm diving straight into the deep end of conversation design facilitating and optimizing customer service interactions with virtual agents and then seamless handoff to live agents. (If I literally dive into the deep end, I'll for sure drown because I get nervous swimming.)

                     TL;DR I'm a linguist, educator, programmer, and voice/conversation designer.

                     In my off time, I take on home renovation projects in my 200-year-old colonial home in New Jersey. (Well, it's my dad's) There's something about working with my hands that makes me kiss my own biceps! Other than that, I do my best to practice minimalism; I have a deep appreciation for experience rather than materialism. Most of my experiences lately have been on Zoom, but I'm hopeful I'll get to travel again 😎
