                     Raised in a Spanish-English bilingual household, my tongue was the sharpest tool 🔧 I had and I wanted to refine it even more by understanding language as a science. From there, 
                     I studied linguistics 💬 and areas complementing it. Briefly, I was a special education teacher assistant and found significant value in shadowing speech-language pathologists. 
                     Drawing upon their techniques enhanced my experience as an English teacher 👩🏻‍🏫 allowing me to cultivate students' fluency and accent reduction.

                     <br> 
                     But everything changed when the fire nation attacked ... Just kidding! I went on to earn my master's in <i>la bellisima</i> Barcelona. 🍷💃🏻 As a graduate student, I took on translation work here and there but what I really took to were positions regarding natural language processing 
                     and artificial intelligence. Taking on web development gave me the opportunity to build projects from scratch considering factors such as processes to make things "go," the interface design,
                     and user experience. ✨

                     At the moment, I'm diving straight into the deep end of conversation design facilitating and optimizing interactions. If I literally dive into the deep end, I'll for sure drown because I get nervous swimming. 😞
                     <br> 
                     <br>
                     TL;DR I'm a linguist, educator, programmer, and voice/conversation designer. 🤹🏻‍♀️🦸‍♀️

                     From the perspective of a special educator and linguist, a simple "hello" 👋🏻 can be challenging but once out there can jumpstart a meaningful connection. 
                     Viewing Grice's maxims in practice, sometimes with palpable efforts, I've grown eager to transform data 💾 in all its forms into something with personality for connections
                     and experiences with purpose.

                     In my off time, I take on home renovation projects in my family's 200-year-old colonial 🏡 in New Jersey. There's something about working with my hands that makes me 
                     kiss my own biceps! Other than that, I do my best to practice minimalism and <i>experience</i>. Rather than upgrade my old Samsung phone, I 
                     choose to buy flights and eat street food in, say, Peru. 🥟 Most of my experiences lately have been on Zoom, but I'm hopeful I'll get to travel again. 😎
